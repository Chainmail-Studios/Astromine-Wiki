# Astromine Wiki

Astromine is a Minecraft mod made by a team of developers, originally made for ModFest 1.16. As time passed, we realized it could be much more than just a jam thing, and decided to expand its original ideals and objectives massively; eventually turning it into a fully fledged technological mod!

As of right now, Astromine is a complete content mod that you can already play with in survival, with a basic technological progression.
